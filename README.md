# ancient_MAG_pipeline

A set of python scripts intended to help in the analysis of ancient metagenomic data files processed through [centrifuge](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/ "Link to Centrifuge homepage"). The order of use isn't fixed, and you can use many of the scripts independently. That said, it's worth reading the specific requirements for each step as often input file naming conventions are based on the output files from previous steps.
